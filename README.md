# Basic Image Processing with OpenCV

This project demonstrates fundamental image processing techniques using Python and the OpenCV library. It serves as an introductory implementation of geometric transformations, color space conversions, and edge detection algorithms.

## 🚀 Features

The script performs the following operations on an input image:

* **Resizing:** Scales the image down to 50% of its original size.
* **Rotation:** Rotates the image 90 degrees clockwise.
* **Grayscale Conversion:** Converts the BGR image to a single-channel Grayscale format.
* **Edge Detection:** Implements the Canny Edge Detection algorithm to identify structural boundaries.
